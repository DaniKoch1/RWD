    <h1 style="margin-top: 15%">What is Star Pizza?</h1>
    <p >Our pizzeria originated as a family business. The first Star Pizza was opened in a small Polish village called Pasikurowice. The idea was to creat a place for passionate people and enable them to develop themselves at the place. The name associates with the telescopes that were the first hobbystic things avaible at the place. Now there can also be found easels for paintings, diversive music instruments, a corner of inspiration for poets and other writers, a movie corner whith different stage props, an DIY corner and a family room of creativness. There are also concerts (mostly jazz and classical) and balls orginized. Besides the artistic part we are offering the best pizza and pierogi in Europe. So don't hesitate and pay us a visit! Nowadays Star Pizza can be found not only in Pasikurowice, but also in 5 other citys in Poland and 12 other countries in Europe. Find your closest Star Pizza and make it your favourite spot!</p>
