    <h1>Exercise, Fifth RWD Session</h1>
    <p>Working with the CSS box and styling links.</p>
    <div id="LeftSide">
        <ol>
            <li>Make a new folder for this session</li>
            <li>Copy your Star Pizza homepage into the new folder and work on this copy</li>
            <li>Make separate HTML pages for each of your menu categories (pizzas, Pasta, Beverages etc.). Make links to them on the main page.</li>
            <li>Add an About page and write a little story about Star Pizza. Include the “About us” page in your links on the main page.</li>
            <li>Style each of your pages with a different background image or color. Pick your image so that it matches the content on the page. Cover the whole page by repeating or stretching the image.</li>
            <li>Create a style for your links so that they appear as buttons on the main page.</li>
            <li>In a new HTML document (not related to the Star Pizza website), create a style that can insert a textbox with borders in another textbox like shown on the image on the right. <span id="hint">HINT: To get the text box to be on the right side, use:
				<span id="flt">float</span>: <span id="rght">right</span>;</span>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="RightSide"> 
        <img src="images/BoxInBox.png" alt="BoxInBox" />
